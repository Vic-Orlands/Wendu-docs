<Info>
  **Prerequisite**: This project uses Next 14 and higher. Hence, install adequate Node.js (version 19 or higher) before
  proceeding.
</Info>

Follow these steps to install and run Wendu on your operating system:

**Step 1**: Clone the repository and navigate to the directory:

<CodeGroup>

```bash bash
git clone https://github.com/cloudplexo/wendu-app-v2.git
cd wendu-app-v2
```

</CodeGroup>

**Step 2**: Install dependencies (npm is preferred for consistency):

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install
```

```bash yarn
yarn install
```
</CodeGroup>

**Step 3**: In the root directory, execute the following command:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm run dev
```

```bash yarn
yarn dev
```
</CodeGroup>

A local preview of the application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Custom Ports

By default, Next.js uses port 3000. However, If you attempt to run Next.js on a port that's already in use, it will use the next available port:

```md
Port 3000 is in use, trying 3001 instead.
```

## Deployment

<Tip>
  Before pushing to GitHub, first build the changes locally to make sure everything is in order. If the build breaks, identify and fix where necessary especially TypeScript errors/issues.
</Tip>

After you have pushed to GitHub. Navigate to Actions (GitHub actions) to deploy the test branch (in this case: `pages` or whatever branch you created). Run and wait for successful deployment.

If the build and deployment is successful, you should see the following:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/quickstart/github-actions.png" style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }} />
</Frame>

Go to Test URL to see recent changes. [https://app-stag.wendu.io/](https://app-stag.wendu.io/)

## Code Formatting

We suggest using extensions like Prettier on your IDE to recognize and format your components. If you're a VSCode user, you can use [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) for code formatting.
